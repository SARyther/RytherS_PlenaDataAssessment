# RytherS_PlenaDataAssessment

To run, simply open in Visual Studio and run in the debugger (click "Play" button).

The assessment took me about 30 minutes to complete.

I could start remotely as early as Thursday! To relocate on-site I would likely require relocation assistance and a week or two to make plans for moving though.

No, I am not currently available to work from Orem. I am currently in Hastings, NE. However, I would be happy to work remotely or relocate (see above)!
